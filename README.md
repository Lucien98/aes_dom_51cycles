# Masked AES Implementations Based on DOM
This project utilizes a modified version of the round-based architecture (excluding the S-Boxes) from [compress_artifact](https://github.com/cassiersg/compress_artifact), with specific adaptations to the scheduling of the input linear mapping to the S-box.

For evaluations of these implementations, please refer to [MaskedAES](https://github.com/Lucien98/MaskedAES).
